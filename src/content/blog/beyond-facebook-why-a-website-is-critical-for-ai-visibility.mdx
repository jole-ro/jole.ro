faqs:
  - question: "Why is a Facebook page not enough for AI?"
    answer: "Social media platforms are 'walled gardens'. AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini often have restricted access to social data, whereas websites are public and easier for AI to crawl and analyze."
  - question: "How do AI tools find my business?"
    answer: "AI tools use large datasets and web crawlers to find information. A structured website with clear business details (NAP) acts as the primary 'source of truth' for these AI 'Search Engines'."
  - question: "What is AI Search Optimization?"
    answer: "It is the practice of structuring your website's data so that AI models can easily find, understand, and recommend your business to users."
  - question: "Should I delete my Facebook page?"
    answer: "No! Social media is great for engagement, but your website should be the central hub where all permanent business information resides."

**🚀 The Bottom Line:** In the age of **Generative AI**, your business needs to be more than just a social media profile. While Facebook is great for engagement, **ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude** rely on the public web to verify facts. Without a dedicated website, your business is invisible to the tools your customers are using to search for services today.

For businesses aiming to stay ahead of the curve, [Jolero](#how-jolero-can-help) specializes in building **AI-ready websites** that ensure your brand is cited as a trusted source by the world's most advanced AI models.

## <i class="ri-robot-line icon-gradient"></i> AI Tools Don't Scroll Facebook

When someone asks an AI tool, "Where is the best local contractor near me?", the AI model doesn't log into Facebook to check your latest post. It crawls the open web, looking for **structured, indexed data**. If your only presence is behind a social media login, the AI simply moves on to your competitor who has a searchable website.

    <p class="text-indigo-900 font-bold mb-2 flex items-center gap-2">
        <i class="ri-lightbulb-fill text-indigo-600">Key Takeaway:</i>
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-medium italic">
        A website is the <strong>"Source of Truth"</strong> for AI. Social media data is transient and often restricted, making it unreliable for AI brand citations.
    </p>
</div>

## <i class="ri-global-line icon-gradient"></i> Owning Your Digital "Real Estate"

Relying solely on a Facebook page means you are building your business on **rented land**. Algorithms change, accounts can be locked, and platforms can go out of style. A website is your own digital territory—a permanent home that is always accessible to everyone (and every AI crawler) 24/7.

<div class="bg-indigo-50 border-l-4 border-indigo-600 p-6 my-8 rounded-r shadow-sm not-prose">
    <p class="text-indigo-900 font-bold mb-2 flex items-center gap-2">
        <i class="ri-lightbulb-fill text-indigo-600">Key Takeaway:</i>
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-medium italic">
        Social media is for <strong>conversations</strong>; your website is for <strong>conversions</strong> and permanent credibility in the global knowledge graph.
    </p>
</div>

## <i class="ri-search-eye-line icon-gradient"></i> Data Verification & Trust

AI models are trained to prioritize **verified information**. When your business details appear and are consistent across your website, Google Business Profile, and local directories, AI tools assign your brand a "trust score." A standalone Facebook page lacks the metadata needed to establish this professional level of authority.

<div class="bg-indigo-50 border-l-4 border-indigo-600 p-6 my-8 rounded-r shadow-sm not-prose">
    <p class="text-indigo-900 font-bold mb-2 flex items-center gap-2">
        <i class="ri-lightbulb-fill text-indigo-600">Key Takeaway:</i>
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-medium italic">
        Consistency across a website and local listings is the <strong>secret sauce</strong> to getting mentioned by AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini.
